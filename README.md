# python-challenge
PyBank: Using Jupyter to determine the desired assignment outcomes. I did use YouTube instruction videos to use the trial and error method to finalize the code and format some strings to add $ and parenthesis around numbers, and rounding.
PyPoll: Using Jupyter to finalize the voting results. I watched YouTube videos to help me write the code to outline the required asks for this project.
For both assignments I did Google how to create the output txt file.
I did not borrow any code, I watched videos and created my own code.
